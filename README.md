# Backend for a Social Networking App

## Description
This application functions as the back end for a social networking site. It's an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

Here's the link to how it works: [click here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiAcGpnOWXwvV8faFy1mFmlxY0DaqWVdb).

## Code Snippets
```javascript
// Create thought based on user input sent through the request body
    createThought(req, res) {
        Thought.create(req.body)
            .then((thought) => {
                return User.findOneAndUpdate(
                    { _id: req.body.userId },
                    { $addToSet: { thoughts: thought._id } },
                    { new: true }
                );
            })
            .then((user) =>
                !user
                    ? res.status(404).json({
                        message: 'Thought created, but found no user with that ID',
                    })
                    : res.json('Created the thought ðŸŽ‰')
            )
            .catch((err) => {
                res.status(500).json(err);
            });
    },
```
This is the functionality used to create a new thought and associate it to an existinng user. First, we want to instantiate a new 'thought' based on the model we have already created. Only after this has been successful, do we want to make sure there exists a user to associate it to. If there is, then we'll find this user based on the `userId` we received through the request's body, and add the new thought's id to our `thoughts` array in our user (this array holds pointers to the thoughts as id's). Using `{ new: true }` we are able to see this new change in our response. If this was successful, then we receive a message confirming the creation of the model and its association, or that the thought was created but no user was found based on the provided id.
